# NGINX Based External Kubernetes Service Load Balancer
## Overview

The Load Balancer - External (LBEX) is a Kubernetes Service Load balancer.  LBEX works like a cloud provider load balancer when one isn't available or when there is one but it doesn't work as desired.  LBEX watches the Kubernetes API server for services that request an external load balancer and self configures to provide load balancing to the new service.

LBEX provides the ability to:
- Service network traffic on any Linux distribution that supports the installation of [NGINX](http://nginx.org/en/), running:
    -  on bare metal, as a container image or static binary
    -  on a cloud instance, as a container image or static binary
    -  on a Kubernetes cluster as a container image in a Pod   
- Proxy/Load Balance traffic to: 
    - A Kubernetes worker host's IP Address and Node Port 
        - If the node host is a cloud instance, lbex is capable of utilizing either the private or public IP address
    - A Kubernetes Pod IP Address and Port
    - A Kubernetes ClusterIP Address and ServicePort 

LBEX is built to use Kubernetes 1.5+, via the [client-go API](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go), and the current [stable community version of NGINX](http://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html#stable).  Providing load balancing / proxy support for both TCP and UDP traffic is a minimum requirement for general [Kubernetes Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).  As such, NGINX is the logical choice for its' UDP load balancing capabilities.

### Connectivity
A deployment of LBEX requires, at a minimum, network connectivity to both the Kubernetes API server and at least one destination address subnet. The API server can be accessed via `kubectl proxy` for development, but this is not recommended for production deployments. For normal operation, the standard access via [`kubeconfig`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/authenticate-across-clusters-kubeconfig/) or the Kubernetes API Server endpoint is supported. Network access must be available to at least one destination address space, either the ClusterIP Service IP address space, the Pod IP address space, or the host worker node's IP address space (public or private).

The LBEX application can run in any environment where some reasonable combination of access to these two resources is available.

## Running LBEX
All of the NGINX configuration is managed by LBEX. The only requirement is that NGINX be installed and executable on the host operating system that LBEX will run on. The LBEX NGINX instance cannot be used for any other purpose. LBEX writes, overwrites, and deletes all of NGINX's configuration files repeatedly during normal operation. As such it doesn't play well with any other configuration management system or human operators. 

As noted [above](#overview), LBEX can run as a static binary, a container image under a container runtime, or in a Kubernetes [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/). Regardless of the runtime environment, LBEX has a number of command line options that define how it operates.
```

```
### Configuration Flags
Without going in to an explanation of all of the parameters, many of which should have sufficient explanation in the help provided, of particular interest to controlling the operation of LBEX are the following:<br />
<b>--health-check</b> - Defaults to true, but may be disabled by passing a value of false. Allows external service monitors to check the health of `lbex` itself.<br />
<b>--health-port</b> - Defaults to 7331, but may be set to any valid port number value.<br />
<b>--kubeconfig</b> - Use the referenced kubeconfig for credentialed access to the cluster.<br />
<b>--proxy</b> - Use the `kubectl proxy` URL for access to the cluster. See for example [using kubectl proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/access-cluster/#using-kubectl-proxy).<br />
<b>--service-name</b> - Provide load balancing **only** for the specified service.<br />
<b>--service-pool</b> - Provide load balancing for services that specify the corresponding annotation value based on specified conditions<br />
<b>--strict-affinity</b> - Provide load balancing **only** for services that exactly match the value of --service-pool.<br />
<b>--anti-affinity</b> - Provide load balancing **only** for services that **do not**  match the value of --service-pool.<br />
<b>--require-port</b> - Makes the annotation "loadbalancer.lbex/port" required (true), or optional (false).<br />

### Environment Variables
LBEX is configurable through command line configuration flags, and through a subset of environment variables. Any configuration value set on the command line takes precedence over the same value from the environment.

The format of the environment variable for flag for flag is composed of the prefix `LBEX_` and the reamining text of the flag in all uppper case with all hyphens replaced by underscores.  Fore example, `--example-flag` would map to `LBEX_EXAMPLE_FLAG`. 

Not every flag can be set via an environment variable.  This is due to the fact that the set of flags is an aggregate of those that belong to LBEX and 3rd party Go packages.  The set of flags that do have corresponding environment variable support are listed below:
* --anti-affinity
* --health-check
* --health-port
* --kubeconfig
* --proxy
* --require-port
* --service-name
* --service-pool

### Details
The health check service is the HTTP endpoint `/`.  An HTTP GET Request applied to the endpoint simply returns the string `healthy` in the HTTP Response body, with a `200` Response Code if the service is running. For example:
```
$ curl http://10.150.0.2:7331/ -w "HTTP Response Code: %{http_code}\n"
healthy
HTTP Response Code: 200
```

There is an implied ordering to accessing the Kubernetes cluster. LBEX will attempt to establish credentialed cluster access via the following methods listed in priority order:
1. If `--proxy string` is provided, use it; methods 2 and 3 are not attempted
2. If `--kubeconfig string` is provided, use it; method 3 is not attempted
3. If neither method is specified, then assume we are running inside a Kubernetes Pod and use the associated Service Account. See detailed information [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/.)

Note above that only one attempt is made to access the cluster. Regardless of which method is used, it is the only method attempted. If the selected method fails, then LBEX terminates immediately without attempting any other access. Therefore, it is unnecessary to specify more than one access method.

The `--service-name` option allows you to provide a 1:1 mapping of load balancers to services, should you desire to do so. The identified service must still provide the required annotation, `kubernetes.io/loadbalancer-class: loadbalancer-lbex`, but no other services will have their traffic managed by this instance of LBEX, regardless of whether or not they supply the requisite annotation.  

The `--service-pool` option allows you to provide affinity to an abstract mapping. For example, you could specify `--service-pool=web-server` to indicate that all Kubernetes Services that define the `loadbalancer.lbex/service-pool: web-server` annotation should be managed by LBEX instance(s)that are designated via this flag/annotation affinity.  Note, this does not prevent LBEX from providing load balancing for other Kubernetes Services that define no affinity via the service pool annotation unless the `--strict-affinity` flag is also speified.

The `--strict-affinity` option allows you to provide affinity for Kubernetes Services that are selected as described above for the `--service-pool` flag.  When this flag is set to true all services that don't strictly match are ignored. 

The `--anti-affinity` option allows you to provide anti-affinity for Kubernetes Services that are not selected as described above for the `--service-pool` flag.  When this flag is set to true all services that strictly match are ignored. 

## Using LBEX Example
The following is an example of deploying a Kubernetes Service that uses LBEX for its external load balancer. Assume that our cluster provides an [NTP Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) as a Kubernetes [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/). The example shown here is actually more verbose than necessary, but that's entirely for illustration. We'll revisit this example after a full discussion of Annotations. The following Kubernetes [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) [Specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.6/#servicespec-v1-core) would configure LBEX for the NTP Service.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cluster-local-ntp
  labels:
    name: ntp-service
    app: ntp
    version: 1.0.0
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/loadbalancer-class: loadbalancer-lbex
    loadbalancer.lbex/port: 123
    loadbalancer.lbex/algorithm: round_robin
    loadbalancer.lbex/upstream-type: node
    loadbalancer.lbex/node-set: host
    loadbalancer.lbex/node-address-type: internal
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector: 
    app: ntp-pod
  ports:
  - name: ntp-listener
    protocol: UDP
    port: 123
    nodePort: 30123
```

### How It Works
The preceding Service Specification contains nothing out of the ordinary aside from the metadata object's annotations. Annotations are discussed in detail in the next [section](#annotations). Here, they are shown primarily for illustration purposes, and have the effect of defining:
- an NGINX load balancer that accepts incoming traffic on UDP port 123
- distributes network traffic, round robin, to all Pods running the NTP service
- network traffic is delivered to the worker node's UDP node port 30123
- service port internal to the cluster is still 123

LBEX is supplemental to any other load balancer(s) currently in existence in the cluster. Specifically, LBEX in no way affects the native Kubernetes `kube-proxy` based `iptables` load balancing. An intended consequence is that any other load balancer defined for a service can operate in parallel with little or no restrictions.  

As a final note, it is very likely that a significant portion of the popular NGINX server [configuration directives](http://nginx.org/en/docs/dirindex.html) will eventually become available as configurable options via Kubernetes ConfigMaps in future releases.  

## Annotations
Kubernetes [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) currently play a central role in defining how LBEX is used by each individual Kubernete Service.  Ideally this configuration data will be migrated to Kubernetes [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/) soon.  When, and if, that happens support will be provided for all existing annotations for several subsequent versions.

### Annotation Descriptions 
The only mandatory value that must be present for LBEX to serve traffic for the intended Kubernetes Service is `kubernetes.io/loadbalancer-class`.  The annotation `loadbalancer.lbex/port-name` is conditioinally required.  This requirement can be relaxed by running an LBEX instance with the `--require-port=false` option thus making the optional. Every other annotation has either a sensible default or is strictly optional.

<b>kubernetes.io/loadbalancer-class: loadbalancer-lbex</b> - No default.  Mandatory.  Indicates that this Service requires the LBEX external load balancer.

<b>loadbalancer-port.lbex/[port-name]</b> - No default. Port name should be set to the name of the service port, unless the service only exposes one port, in which case either the port name or ``unnamed`` would work. This port is normally set to the same value as the service port. This value is primarily used to differentiate between two services that both utilize the same port, which is standard Kubernetes supported behavior. However, at the edge of the network, it is required that the ports (or IP address) be unique. Optionally, LBEX can be run on as many servers (bare metal, virtual, or cloud instances) as needed to provide uniqueness at the interface / IP address level. However, where this is not a practical option, the `[port-name]` annotation allows us to disambiguate between shared ports in the Service Specification itself.  Note: this behavior can be modified by the flag `--required-port`, defined in the section [Running LBEX](#running-lbex).  If `--required-port=false` then this value can be ommited in the ServiceSpec.

For example in the following service definition:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    run: my-nginx
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/loadbalancer-class: loadbalancer-lbex
    loadbalancer-port.lbex/http: 8080
    loadbalancer-port.lbex/https: 8443
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    run: my-nginx
``` 

The ```loadbalancer-port.lbex/[port-name]``` annotations are ```loadbalancer-port.lbex/http: 8080``` and ```loadbalancer-port.lbex/https: 8443```


<b>loadbalancer.lbex/algorithm</b> - Defaults to round robin, but can also be set to least connections. The option to select least time (lowest measured time) is supported, but can only be used with NGINX Plus.

<b>loadbalancer.lbex/method</b> - method is a supplemental argument to the least_time directive.  Similarly, it is supported in LBEX but requires NGINX Plus to function.  See reference: [least_time](http://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_module.html#least_time).

<b>loadbalancer.lbex/resolver</b> - Configures name servers used to resolve names of upstream servers into addresses. See reference: [resolver](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html#resolver).

<b>loadbalancer.lbex/upstream-type</b> - The upstream-type indicates the type of the backend service addresses to direct to. The default, `node`, directs load balanced traffic to the Kubernetes host worker node and node port. Alternatively, `pod` directs traffic to the Kubernetes Pod and its corresponding port. Finally, `cluster-ip' directs traffic to the Kubernetes Service's ClusterIP.

The next two annotations are only read if, and only if, `loadbalancer.lbex/upstream-type=node`. 

<b>loadbalancer.lbex/node-set</b> - Selects the set of Kubernetes host worker nodes to add to the upstream for the load balancer. The default `host` ensures that traffic is only directed to nodes that are actively running a copy of the service's backend pod. By contrast, `all` will direct traffic to any available Kubernetes worker node.

<b>loadbalancer.lbex/node-address-type</b> - Determines whether to direct load balanced traffic to the node's `internal` private IP address (default), or the `external` public IP address. 

<b>loadbalancer.lbex/service-pool</b> - No Default.  Service pools can provide a mapping from any abstract partition to a pool of LBEX instances that provide traffic handling for the partition.  If the Service Specification defines the `service-pool` annotation, then LBEX will serve traffic for the service if the LBEX instance is a member of that service pool.  Note: this behavior can be modified by the flags `--strict-affinity` and `--anti-affinity` as described in [Running LBEX](#running-lbex). 

### Annotation Selection
It is incumbent on the service designer to make sensible selections for annotation values. For example, it makes no sense to select a node address type of `external` if the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster haven't been created with external IP addresses. It would also be off to try to select an upstream type of `cluster-ip` if 1) the service doesn't provide one, or 2) LBEX is not running as a Pod inside the Kubernetes the cluster. By definition a cluster IP address is only accessible to members of the cluster.

## Using LBEX Example - Revisited
Returning to the pervious example, here is the updated version that takes advantage of the default values for all but the one required annotation. As before, the following Service Specification would configure LBEX for the NTP Service.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cluster-local-ntp
  labels:
    name: ntp-service
    app: ntp
    version: 1.0.0
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/loadbalancer-class: loadbalancer-lbex
 spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector: 
    app: ntp-pod
  ports:
  - name: ntp-listener
    protocol: UDP
    port: 123
    nodePort: 30123
```

So, by taking advantage of several sensible defaults, and the fact that this LBEX instance is running with a relaxed port requirement (`--require-port false`), the service's definition is exactly as it would be were it not using LBEX aside from the addition of a one line annotation.

## Installation on Google Cloud

The bash scripts for installation on Google Cloud are provided under the [bin](bin) folder.

Run either: `./gce-up.sh --help`, or: `./gce-down.sh --help` to see the list of supported options:

```
Usage:

gce-up.sh or gce-down.sh [flags]

Flags are:
-c|--cidr            - CIDR range for LBEX instance IP addresses, big enough for at least 'num-autoscale' IPs. Should not clash with GKE cluster ip space. Default is 10.150.0.0/28.
-h|--help            - Show this help.

-i|--project         - Google project id. Required.
-m|--cluster-name    - Target GKE cluster name. Required for gce-up.sh.
-n|--name            - base name for all lbex resource. Required.
-p|--health-port     - LBEX health check port. Default is 7331.
-r|--region          - GCE region name. Default is us-central1.
-s|--num-autoscale   - Maximum number of auto-scaled LBEX instances. Default is 10.
-t|--cluster-network - GCE network name of the GKE cluster. Must be a custom type network. Required
-z|--cluster-zone    - Target GKE cluster primary zone. Default is us-central1-a.

For example:
gce-up.sh --name mylbex --project k8s-work --cidr 10.128.0.0/28 --region us-central1 --cluster-name my-k8s-cluster --num-autoscale 10 --cluster-zone us-central1-a --cluster-network my-cluster-network --health-port 1337
or
gce-down.sh --name mylbex --region us-central1 --project k8s-work
```

### Google Cloud Prerequisites

For LBEX to work with your GKE cluster, the cluster must have been created with non-default, non-automatic [subnet network](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks#subnet_network). You will need to provide your cluster's name, network name and a CIDR block that does not conflict with any existing CIDR blocks in your GKE cluster's subnet network.

### Running the Scripts

For example, given a GKE cluster named `mycluster` with primary zone of `us-central1-a`; created using a subnet network `mynetwork` with one `us-central1` subnet with a CIDR of `10.128.0.0/20` in a Google Project named `myproject`:

```
./gce-up.sh \
  --name my-lbex \
  --project myproject \
  --region us-central1 \
  --cidr 10.150.0.0/28 \
  --cluster-name mycluster \
  --cluster-zone us-central1-a \
  --cluster-network mynetwork 
```
This will create an autoscaling managed instance group in `us-central1`, that will scale to max `10`, minimum `2` instances, auto-heal based on lbex health check at default port `7331` and with CIDR `10.150.0.0/28`. It will monitor the API server of GKE cluster `mycluster` for services for which it will provide external load balancing.

## NGINX Prerequisites

For TCP and UDP load balancing to work, the NGINX image must be built with the `--with-stream` configuration flag to load/enable the required stream processing modules. In most cases the [NGINX Official Repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) 'latest' tagged image will include the stream modules by default. The easiest way to be certain that the modules are included is to dump the configuration and check for their presence.

For example, running the following command against the `nginx:latest` image shows the following (line breaks added for clarity):

    $ docker run -t nginx:latest nginx -V
    nginx version: nginx/1.11.10
    built by gcc 4.9.2 (Debian 4.9.2-10)

As you can see several stream modules are included in the NGINX build configuration. 

## Motivation
The LBEX project was started to address a specific case where a Google Container Engine (GKE) based Kubernetes Service required an external load balancer, but not a public IP address.  Moreover, the GCP Internal Load balancer currently does not support traffic to/from the GCP CloudVPN (See: [Internal Load Balancing Restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/internal/#restrictions) - *"You cannot send traffic through a VPN tunnel to your load balancer IP."*). As work progressed on LBEX, some simple extensions made it potentially useful for solving a larger set of problems.

A very specific use case arises for Google Container Engine (GKE) based Kubernetes services that require an external load balancer, but not a public IP address. These services need to be exposed to RFC1918 address spaces, but that address space is neither part of the Cluster's IP address space, or the [GCP Subnet Network](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#subnet_network) Auto [IP Ranges](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#ip_ranges). This is particularly challenging when connecting to GCP via [Google Cloud VPN](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpn/overview), where the on premise peer network side of the VPN is also an RFC1918 10/8 network space. This configuration, in and of itself, presents certain challenges described here: [GCI IP Tables Configuration](https://github.com/sostheim/gci-iptables-conf-agent). Once the two networks are interconnected, there remains the issue of communicating with the GCP region's private IP subnet range, and further being able to reach exposed Kubernetes services in the Kubernetes Cluster CIDR range.

There were several attempts at solving this problem with a combination of various [Google Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/) components, including using the [GCP Internal Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/internal/) and following the model provided by the [Internal Load Balancing using HAProxy on Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/internal-load-balancing-haproxy) example.

In the end, the best solution available before LBEX was 1) not dynamic and 2) exposed a high order ephemeral port.  
1. This meant that, since the GCP Internal LB solution had to have stable endpoints, there was an external requirement to ensure that service specifications conformed to certain constraints. Conversely, any time a service configuration change was made, or a new service introduced into the environment, a corresponding LB had to created and/or updated.
2. This was first and foremost unsightly and awkward to manage. Over time it was the leaky abstraction that was the most bothersome and provided extra motivation to move forward with LBEX.
 
Finally, there are challenges to automating all these things as well. None of them are insurmountable by any means, but when justifying the engineering effort to automate operations you prefer to automate the right solution.  

## Cutting a release

Install github-release from https://github.com/c4milo/github-release  
Create a github personal access token with repo read/write permissions and export it as GITHUB_TOKEN  
Adjust VERSION and TYPE variables in the [Makefile](Makefile) as needed  
Run ```make release```
